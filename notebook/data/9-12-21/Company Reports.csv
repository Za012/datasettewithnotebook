We support urgent collective action seeking to ensure compliance by
all parties in the implementation of the Paris Agreement«s commitments and the fulfillment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) on Climate Action. Advancing climate solutions requires
collaborative cross-industry action and cooperation with governments,
non-profit organizations, and multilateral institutions.
As part of our commitment to support climate action, we recently redefined a more ambitious 2030 target. Aligned with the International Energy
Agency (IEA) Roadmap to limit global warming potential to 2¡C, we aim to
reduce our net specific CO2 emissions by 35% compared to 1990 levels,
reaching 520 kg CO2 per ton of cementitious product.
Up to 2019, we reduced our net CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 22.4% compared with our 1990 baseline, reaching
622 kg CO2 per ton of cementitious material. For 2019 alone, we
avoided emitting approximately 7.5 million tons of CO2, equivalent to
the annual emissions of 1.6 million passenger vehicles. With our new
target, we aim to reduce up to 16 million tons of CO2 by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, equivalent to the annual emissions of 3 million
passenger vehicles. To meet our target, we intend to invest approximately US$130 million in initiatives related to the use of alternative
fuels and raw materials over the next five years.
To this end, we developed a CO2 Reduction Roadmap across all of our
cement sites to model and assess the carbon mitigation potential that
can be seized from each installation, considering local challenges,
regulations, materials supply, technical limitations, and market dynamics, among other decisive factors. Building on this roadmap, we
are reinforcing our role in reducing direct and indirect emissions in
our production process through the implementation of our traditional
and non-traditional CO2 reduction levers, enabled by our research and
development of emerging technologies.",,text,Em.6.1,,,EM-CM,EM-CM-110a.2a,n/a,,,Baltzell

 so as to contribute to
the reduction of carbon in Kyushu.
 _ Proactive development of renewable energy, maximum acceptance,
utilization of nuclear power generation on the premise of ensuring safety,
and utilization of power that does not produce CO2
_ Promote electrification on the demand side of energy through electric
vehicles (EV) and heat pump technology
_ Business Performance Targets
_ Make a 70% contribution to Kyushu's CO2 emission reduction (26 million tons)
 _ Develop renewable energy systems to produce 5 million kW of energy by
2030 [Development output]
 (2.5 million kW [equity output])
_ Scope 1 emissions trends: 26.4 million tons in 2017, 17.56 million tons in
2018, and 19.04 million tons in 2019.
 In May, 2020, we participated as a member company in the Consortium for
the Promotion of Electric Vehicle Utilization (hereinafter referred to as the
Consortium) to help spread the popularity of electric commercial vehicles.
 In addition, we have set a goal of modifying all company vehicles (excluding

essential for the power generation business.
Our hydroelectric power business is in compliance with laws and regulations
regarding water intake. At hydroelectric power plants of or larger than a specific
size, we release water to maintain the river environment. Our thermal power
generation business collects and reuses water for power generation to reduce
the amount of water intake. Our thermal power generation business and
nuclear power generation business use seawater as indirect cooling water for
power generation facilities. As such, we monitor the temperature difference
between water intake and discharge.
The results of verifying water stress in the current and future facility locations
using WRI Aqueduct 3.0 tools to identify water risks are as follows:
According to the Baseline Water Stress tool, maximum water stress is
low-medium in the Kyushu region where we have installed a power plant that
uses fresh water or seawater. Water-related risks such as droughts are
assumed to occur less frequently there.
* The extension of the section where the water flow rate of the river decreases due to water
intake for hydroelectric power generation is 10 km or more, and the water collection area is
200 km_.",,,WR.3.2,,,IF-EU,IF-EU-140a.3a,n/a,,,Baltzell

fiscal 2013). CO2 emissions were 139.2 million tons in fiscal 2013, and were reduced to 92.6 million tons in fiscal 2019 due to the spread

generation accounts for about 98% of the total. The use of water resources is essential for a clean hydroelectric power generation
business that does not emit CO2 during power generation, and the following risk management is carried out.
At dams and downstream of embankments at hydroelectric power plants, the water necessary to maintain the environment of the
river is discharged, and the amount of water withdrawn from the river for power generation complies with the amount of water intake
permitted by law. In addition, when river flooding due to heavy rain is expected, water will be discharged in advance from the dam
based on the flood control agreement with the national government, and it plays an important role in reducing heavy rain damage in
regional disaster prevention.
The results of verifying water stress in the area where our facility is located by using ÒWRI Aqueduct Water Risk AtlasÓ tool to identify water
risk are as follows.
According to the ""Baseline Water Stress"", water stress is ""Medium-high"" at the maximum in the business area of the TEPCO Group. So
there are no facilities such as hydroelectric power plants in water-stressed areas, and it is assumed that the frequency of water-related
risks such as drought is low. In ""Future Water Stress"", there is a suggestion that water stress may be higher. With reference to this result,
we will carry out risk assessment based on the actual water usage conditions at specific rivers and basins, as well as at power plants
locations, and will continue to strive for risk management.
In the future, we will consider long-term strategies regarding the impact of physical risks on our facilities such as floods due to climate
change.",,text,WR.3.2,,,IF-EU,IF-EU-140a.3a,n/a,,,Baltzell

Increasing demands from society, the market and other
stakeholders, in addition to competitiveness issues, reinforce
ValeÕs commitment to contribute to a low-carbon economy.
Vale recognizes that climate change represents one of societyÕs
greatest challenges and is committed to contributing to
solutions that limit temperature increases to 2¡C, as defined
in the Paris Agreement. In this regard, in 2019, the Board of
Directors of Vale updated the organizationÕs carbon neutral
mining strategy17.
Vale aims to act actively to induce the neutrality of greenhouse
gas emissions in the steel, metallurgical and shipping chains.
In this context, the companyÕs main commitment is to become
carbon neutral in its operations (scopes 1 and 2) by 2050.
In 2018, the target was set to reduce the intensity of
greenhouse gas emissions by 16%. In 2019, although absolute
emissions were approximately 11% lower, the intensity of
emissions grew 8%18 compared to the base year of 2017.
In 2019, the company published a group of sustainability
goals (link to the governance part - goals), including new
commitments to reduce reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, bolder than goals established previously in 2018,
aiming to become a carbon neutral mining company.
¥ To reduce the absolute emission of scopes 1 and 2 in 2030,
aligned with the Paris Agreement19;
¥ To become carbon neutral (scope 1 and 2) by 2050;
¥ To adopt a shadow price of USD 50 per ton of CO2
equivalent, to be used in the economic feasibility studies
of projects;
To adopt a shadow price of USD 10 a ton of CO2
 equivalent
for carbon sequestration in forest restoration and
reforestation projects;
¥ To adopt a target for scope 3 emissions.","Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets",,,,Em.6.6,,,EM-MM,EM-MM-110a.2a,n/a,,,Baltzell
